I live in Belgium. The keyboard layout used here is AZERTY. Few things I noticed.

### The Bad
#### . VS ;
. is more used when writing text.

; may be more used when programming. . is used a lot as well when programming.

So, its kind of hard to prefer one over another.

#### { vs ç
    
I use { more than I use ç.

So I wrote a AutoHotKey script to swap them.

```ahk
#Requires AutoHotkey v2.0
; Programmer's Azerty
:*:;::. ; ; => .
:*:.::; ; . => ;

:*:ç::{ ; ç => {
```

### The Ugly
[, ] requires AltGr \
´, ` requires AltGr and must be typed twice or with space/other key (dead key)

### The Good
It is not only bad though as a programmer. It also has some positive sides. For some symbols, like &, ", ', (, !, ), $, ; and :, you don't have to press any other keys (Shift, AltGr). Querty would have been nice for programmers if symbols were default instead of numbers.
