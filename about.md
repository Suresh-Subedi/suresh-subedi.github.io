Namaskar. My name is Suresh Subedi. I live in Bruges, Belgium. I am interested in software as well as hardware aspect of systems.
I have played with bldc motors, stm32, esp32, rp2040, arduino. I also have done limited metalworking and want to do more of it.
Professionally, I am a .net developer and I want to grow into a full stack role with modern spa's. Rest of my indulgences are my hobbies.
My most used programming languages are c# with .net, javascript, python and c(++).
Since I spend lots of time in front of computer, I like to balance it with spending more time outside.
I am not a talker, but I like meeting new people, learning things from them and getting to know them.
